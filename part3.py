Part 3.	
Hierarchical Clustering: 
Recall from lecture that agglomerative hierarchical clustering is a greedy iterative scheme that creates clusters, i.e., distinct sets of indices of points, by gradually merging the sets based on some cluster dissimilarity (distance) measure. Since each iteration merges a set of indices there are at most n-1 mergers until the all the data points are merged into a single cluster (assuming n is the total points). This merging process of the sets of indices can be illustrated by a tree diagram called a dendrogram. Hence, agglomerative hierarchal clustering can be simply defined as a function that takes in a set of points and outputs the dendrogram.
